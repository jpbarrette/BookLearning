Fill in the blank entries in the following table, giving the decimal and hexadecimal representations of different powers of 2
* n = 9, 2^9 = 512 (base-10) = 0x200 (base-16)
* n = 19, 2^19 = 3 + 16 = 3 + 4*4 = 0x80000 = (expt 2 19) 524288
* n = (log 16384 2) 2^14 (expt 2 14) , 0x4000
* n = 0 + 4*4 = 2^16 = (expt 2 16) = 65536 (base-10), 0x10000 (base-16)
